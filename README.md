## 📚 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the semester-long Database course project (DBLAB 2024–2025) at ECE, NTUA. The project models and implements a relational database for organizing the **Pulse University International Music Festival**.

The system captures complex real-world requirements related to festival logistics, performances, artist management, ticket sales, staff allocation, and visitor interactions including ticket resale and performance reviews.

## 🧠 Assumptions Made

Additionally to the requirement/assumptions stated in the assignment text, we've assumed the following:

| #  | Assumption |
|----|------------|
| 1  | Performers don't inherit their genre's parent-genres (if they exist). |
| 2  | Appearances of a band member don't count as appearances for the individual members. |
| 3  | Twenty (20) Tech Crew staff are  required per stage/enent. |
| 4  | Only one events takes place on a stage per day. |
| 5  | Entities/tables like visitors, don't include images/description (personal data). |
| 6  | Visitor can buy tickets for events happening at the same time. |
| 7  | Ticket sales begin 1 year prior to the festival's starting date. |

## 🛠 Setup & Usage

To download and test the database locally, follow the steps below:

### 📦 Requirements
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.4+
- MySQL client or GUI (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or phpMyAdmin)

### 💾 Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soufleri/databases2025.git
   cd databases2025
  ```
2. **Create the database:**
  ```bash  
    SOURCE sql/install.sql;
  ```
3. **Load initial data:**
  ```bash
  SOURCE sql/load.sql;
  ```
4. **Run the queries:**
  ```bash
  SOURCE sql/load.sql;
  ```
  You can test each query `Qxx.sql` and compare results with the ones in the corresponding `Qxx_out.txt` files.
